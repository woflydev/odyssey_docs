## About

Mentorship Guide is a resource focused on making mentorship accessible to all.

### Mission

To provide mentors and mentees with strategies, resources, and community support.

### Why

The more mentorship we have, the more inclusive, helpful, collaborative, and innovative our communities become.

### Contributing

This guide is developed by the community for the community. We'd be thankful and honored to have you [contribute](contributing.md) and make the Mentorship Guide better than it is today!

### Code of Conduct

Our community is welcoming, helpful, and inclusive.

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Thank you

## What's next?

Short term, we want to keep connecting and bridging existing strategies, resources, and communities.

Medium term, we want to keep expanding our reach, accounting for even more situational and cultural differences.

Long term, there's opportunities to build tooling and infrastructure that would supercharge mentorship efforts.

A wonderful, ongoing journey! ðŸŽ‰

## Sponsorship is important

In addition to mentorship, sponsorship is important. There are plans to create a sponsorship guide as well. In the meantime, there is sponsorship related content in our [Resources](resources-overview.md) section. Feel free to submit any helpful resources -- thank you! âœ¨
