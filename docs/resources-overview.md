> Mentorship is an act, experience, and opportunity to share what you can, when you can, how you can.

Mentorship means different things to different people, depending on their situation, context, culture, and more. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to mentorship. It's personal and can changes with time.

In that spirit, below are various mentorship resources, talks, articles perspectives, and more:

- [Mentorship Programs and Communities](resources-mentorship-programs.md)
- [Articles](resources-articles.md)
- Talks on mentorship (coming soon!)
- Mental models (coming soon!)
